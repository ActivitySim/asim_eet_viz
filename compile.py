Compile base-vs.-build result visualizations
from ActivitySim output tables, creating
summaries of the changes between two sets
of outputs across the variety of ActivitySim
models.

The compiler first executes the listed Jupyter
notebooks individually, then strips out all
notebook metadata to prepare the executed notebook
for rendering using `quarto`. The render procedure
then creates a set of HTML files from the config
file `_quarto.yml`, with a main page as defined in
`index.qmd` and a separate page for the notebook
itself.

        In the above, I've attempted to use more direct functionality than
        just copying the entire list into the notebook file, like passing
        lambda functions directly, but it seems the nbparameterize module
        can only handle certain types. Therefore, we create a temporary
        notebook and will need to clean it up after quarto has compiled it.
        Definitely a FIXME but not in scope at moment.
