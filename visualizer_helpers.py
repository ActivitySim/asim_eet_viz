    A method that returns the appropriate filters for creating affected-area filters.

    This method creates two function objects - one for filtering a single vector of
    zone IDs, and one for filtering multiple vectors. The latter has the former filter
    as its underlying filter, and the individual vectors are passed to it individually
    before they are combined together using the strategy defined by the `how` parameter.
    
    The `zone_set` parameter is defined as one of the following options:

        - "all"         the returned filters will include all input records regardless
                        of the set of zones defined in the `affected_zones` list

        - "affected"    the returned filters will include only the records whose zone

        - "unaffected"  the returned filters will include only the records whose zone
                        IDs are NOT included in the `affected_zones` list of IDs
    
    The `how` parameter is defined as one of the following options:

        - "all"         the records which are included by the multifilter are those
                        for which ALL of the input series are included by the underlying

                        for which ANY of the input series are included by the underlying
                        filter function

    The `affected_zones` parameter is a list of zone IDs which define the "affected area"
    of a study scenario. This list will be used to filter the Series input into the 
    returned filters, unless the `zone_set` parameter is set to "all".

    The returned tuple is of the format `(monofilter, multifilter)`, where the monofilter
