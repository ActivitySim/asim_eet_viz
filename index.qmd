# Base-vs.-Build Scenario Comparison Visualizer

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks which
develop summary statistics and charts for visualizing the
comparative results of a base and build scenario. 

The notebooks all pull base and build data from directories
specified in `_quarto.yml` under the `sources` setting

To rebuild this website, run the `compile.py` script, which
will pull a list of Jupyter notebooks from `_quarto.yml` to
execute. The outputs from these notebooks will be compiled
into the new website, found in the `output` directory.
